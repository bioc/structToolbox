    "Method objects are similar to model objects in that they implement a method with the exception that they don't follow the same training/test approach as models; they are applied to the full dataset. Method objects can therefore also be used for approaches such as filtering, normalisation and scaling which (usually) get applied to the whole dataset rather than on a training/test basis.\n",
